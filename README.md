## Indivision
The efficacy of government is reflected in the welfare of constituents, so we produced tools that will allow county governments to correlate spending to various wellness metrics.

## Usage
Visit http://siriuscyberneticscorp.cf/ or http://sccorp.cf/ <br>
Navigate through the visualizations by tabs at the top. In each visualization, you can select different metrics to display.

## Installation 
Be sure to install node.js and npm <br>
npm install<br>
npm start<br>
Should now be running on localhost:3000<br>
